Your task is to use Google Map and Laravel to create a page which can download and display data. The basic requirements are:

- [x] Create a new Laravel project
- [x] Set the index page to be a map using Google Maps, 
- [x] Map should take up most/all of the page
- [ ] Allow clicking onto the map to be able add a point 
- [ ] Clicking (this can either be enabled by default, or toggled via a button)
- [ ] Send the added point to the database after adding
- [ ] After reloading the page, load the saved points onto the map

Once completed, submit this to alistair@thovex.co.uk using a publicly accessible git repository (github etc).

Some other points

Must use PHP 8.1
There will be no need for authentications
The choice of database storage, JS assets, frontend design and structure, and backend structure, will all be up to you
